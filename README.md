# Basic Informational Site

## Basic Informational Site - Overview

This is the first project of the "NodeJS" course within "The Odin Project".

This project acts as an introduction to NodeJS.

In particular, this project aims to create a multi-page application with some basic information.

Please note, the goal of this project is to get acquainted with the very basics of NodeJS; the content in this project and the knowledge and skills displayed are very rudimentary.
Therefore, I've decided not to host this project as I usually do.

If truly want to view this project, please follow the instructions in the "Viewing This Project" section.
